Frequently used methods of class Mat:
elemSize( )
total( ) - returns the total number of items in a mat.
isContinuous( ) - tells us if the image has been padded or not.

Advanced Topics:
For efficiency reasons, an image can be padded with extra pixels at the end of each row.

If you subtract its Laplacian from an image, the image edges are amplified giving a sharper image.

If you apply a mask, the operation is performed only on pixels for which the mask value is not null (the mask must be 1-channel).
